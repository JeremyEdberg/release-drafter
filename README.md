## Usage

1. Install the [Release Drafter GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/release-drafter) into the repositories you wish to automatically create releases in.
2. Add a `.github/release-drafter.yml` configuration file to each repository.

## Example

For example, take the following `.github/release-drafter.yml` file in a repository:

```yml
template: |
  ## What's Changed

  $CHANGES
```

As pull requests are merged, a draft release is kept up-to-date listing the changes, ready to publish when you‚Äôre ready:

## Template variables

You can use any of the following variables in your template, and they‚Äôll be substituted when the release is regenerated:

|Variable|Description|
|-|-|
|`$CHANGES`|The markdown list of pull requests that have been merged.|
|`$PREVIOUS_TAG`|The previous releases‚Äôs tag.|

## Configuration options

You can configure Release Drafter using the following key in your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:

|Key|Required|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`template`|Required|The template for the body of the draft release. Use [template variables](#template-variables) to insert values.|
|`branches`|Optional|The branches to listen for configuration updates to `.github/release-drafter.yml` and for merge commits. Useful if you want to test the app on a pull request branch. Default is the repository‚Äôs default branch.|

Release Drafter also supports [Probot Config](https://github.com/probot/probot-config), if you want to store your configuration files in a central repository.

## Developing

If you have Node v10+ installed locally, you can run the tests, and a local app, using the following commands:

```sh
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Run the tests
npm test

# Run the app locally
npm start
```

If you don't have Node installed, you can use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

```sh
# Run the tests
docker-compose run --rm app npm test
```
