[![NPM package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/release-drafter-github-app.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/release-drafter-github-app)

## Usage

1. Install the [Release Drafter GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/release-drafter), choosing the repositories you want releases automatically created.
2. Add a `.github/release-drafter.yml` configuration file to each repository.

## Example

For example, take the following `.github/release-drafter.yml` file in a repository:

```yml
template: |
  ## What‚Äôs Changed

  $CHANGES
```

As pull requests are merged, a draft release is kept up-to-date listing the changes, ready to publish when you‚Äôre ready:

<img src="design/screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of generated draft release" width="586" />

The following is a more complicated configuration, which categorises the changes into headings, and automatically suggests the next version number:

```yml
name-template: v$NEXT_PATCH_VERSION üåà
tag-template: v$NEXT_PATCH_VERSION
categories:
  - title: üöÄ Features
    label: feature
  - title: üêõ Bug Fixes
    label: fix
  - title: üß∞ Maintenance
    label: chore
change-template: '- $TITLE @$AUTHOR (#$NUMBER)'
template: |
  ## Changes

  $CHANGES
```

## Configuration Options

You can configure Release Drafter using the following key in your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:

| Key                   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `template`            | Required | The template for the body of the draft release. Use [template variables](#template-variables) to insert values.                                                                                                   |
| `name-template`       | Optional | The template for the name of the draft release. For example: `"v$NEXT_PATCH_VERSION"`.                                                                                                                            |
| `tag-template`        | Optional | The template for the tag of the draft release. For example: `"v$NEXT_PATCH_VERSION"`.                                                                                                                             |
| `version-template`    | Optional | The template to use when calculating the next version number for the release. Useful for projects that don't use semantic versioning. Default: `"$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH"`                                           |
| `change-template`     | Optional | The template to use for each merged pull request. Use [change template variables](#change-template-variables) to insert values. Default: `"* $TITLE (#$NUMBER) @$AUTHOR"`.                                        |

| `branches`            | Optional | The branches to listen for configuration updates to `.github/release-drafter.yml` and for merge commits. Useful if you want to test the app on a pull request branch. Default is the repository‚Äôs default branch. |
| `categories`          | Optional | Categorize pull requests using labels. Refer to [Categorize Pull Requests](#categorize-pull-requests) to learn more about this option.                                                                            |

Release Drafter also supports [Probot Config](https://github.com/probot/probot-config), if you want to store your configuration files in a central repository. This allows you to share configurations between projects, and create a organization-wide configuration file by creating a repository named `.github` with the file `.github/release-drafter.yml`.

## Template Variables

You can use any of the following variables in your `template`:

| Variable        | Description                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$CHANGES`      | The markdown list of pull requests that have been merged.                                                             |
| `$CONTRIBUTORS` | A comma separated list of contributors to this release (pull request authors, commit authors, and commit committers). |
| `$PREVIOUS_TAG` | The previous releases‚Äôs tag.                                                                                          |

## Next Version Variables

You can use any of the following variables in your `template`, `name-template` and `tag-template`:

| Variable              | Description                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$NEXT_PATCH_VERSION` | The next patch version number. For example, if the last tag or release was `v1.2.3`, the value would be `v1.2.4`. This is the most commonly used value. |
| `$NEXT_MINOR_VERSION` | The next minor version number. For example, if the last tag or release was `v1.2.3`, the value would be `v1.3.0`.                                       |
| `$NEXT_MAJOR_VERSION` | The next major version number. For example, if the last tag or release was `v1.2.3`, the value would be `v2.0.0`.                                       |

## Version Template Variables

You can use any of the following variables in `version-template` to format the `$NEXT_{PATCH,MINOR,MAJOR}_VERSION` variables:

| Variable | Description               |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| `$PATCH` | The patch version number. |
| `$MINOR` | The minor version number. |
| `$MAJOR` | The major version number. |

## Change Template Variables

You can use any of the following variables in `change-template`:

| Variable  | Description                                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$NUMBER` | The number of the pull request, e.g. `42`.                  |
| `$TITLE`  | The title of the pull request, e.g. `Add alien technology`. |
| `$AUTHOR` | The pull request author‚Äôs username, e.g. `gracehopper`.     |

## Categorize Pull Requests

With the `categories` option you can categorize pull requests in release notes using labels. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:

```yml
categories:
  - title: üöÄ Features
    label: feature
  - title: üêõ Bug Fixes
    label: fix
```

Pull requests with the label "feature" or "fix" will now be grouped together:

<img src="design/screenshot-2.png" alt="Screenshot of generated draft release with categories" width="586" />

Adding such labels to your PRs can be automated by using [PR Labeler](https://github.com/TimonVS/pr-labeler-action) or [Probot Auto Labeler](https://github.com/probot/autolabeler).

## Projects that don't use Semantic Versioning

If your project doesn't follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) you can still use Release Drafter, but you may want to set the `version-template` option to customize how the `$NEXT_{PATCH,MINOR,MAJOR}_VERSION` environment variables are generated.

For example, if your project doesn't use patch version numbers, you can set `version-template` to `$MAJOR.$MINOR`. If the current release is version 1.0, then `$NEXT_MINOR_VERSION` will be `1.1`.

## GitHub Installation Permissions

Release Drafter requires full write, because GitHub does not offer a limited scope for only writing releases. **Don't install Release Drafter to your entire GitHub account ‚Äî only add the repositories you want to draft releases on.**

## Developing

If you have Node v10+ installed locally, you can run the tests, and a local app, using the following commands:

```sh
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Run the tests
npm test

# Run the app locally
npm run dev
```

Once you've started the app, visit `localhost:3000` and you'll get [step-by-step instructions](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configuring-a-github-app) for installing it in your GitHub account so you can start pushing commits and testing it locally.

If you don‚Äôt have Node installed, you can use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

```sh
# Run the tests
docker-compose run --rm app npm test
```

## Contributing

Third-party contributions are welcome! üôèüèº See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for step-by-step instructions.

If you need help or have a question, let me know via a GitHub issue.

## Deployment

If you want to deploy your own copy of Release Drafter, follow the [Probot Deployment Guide](https://probot.github.io/docs/deployment/).

## Releasing

Run the following command:

```bash
git checkout master && git pull && npm version [major | minor | patch]
```

The command does the following:

- Ensures you‚Äôre on master and don‚Äôt have local, un-commited changes
- Bumps the version number in [package.json](package.json) based on major, minor or patch
- Runs the `postversion` npm script in [package.json](package.json), which:
  - Pushes the tag to GitHub
  - Publishes the npm release
  - Deploys to [Now](https://now.sh)
  - Opens the GitHub releases page so you can publish the release notes
